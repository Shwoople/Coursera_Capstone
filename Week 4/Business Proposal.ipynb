    "This project has been designed to help people explore better facilities in their neighbourhood, and in particular finding similar feeling neighbourhoods in places they could move to based on the facilities they're already used to. I hope this will help improve the decision making for people moving to other neighbourhoods in Scarborough, Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "My hope for this project is that it will create an analysis of some of the features in Scarborough so that when people move to variouis neighbourhoods in it they will be able to find similar areas to what they're used to. I will be looking at schools based on ratings, median house prices, crime rates, road connectivity, weather conditions, good emergency response management, leisure facilities as well as water/waste management.\n",

    "The result of this will hopefully be that people will have an awareness of neighbourhoods in Scarborough to consider when needing to move as a result of a new job, turning over a leaf in their life or any other reason to move."
